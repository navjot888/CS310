# CS310 Assignment #2
We can the missing Triominoes problem in the following way:

### The algorithm is as follows:
1. We have declared a Variable names VAR
2. Then created a point to link the two Variable X and Y
3. Created a function to display the 2-Dimensional Vector
4. Function to create a hole into the block
5. And a function to determine the spot occupied by the hole or loop
6. The code iterates further while locating the quadrants where the loop will be created
7. Then it defines a function to drop tile on the block
8. Then applied the divide and conquer recursive algorithm to incremenrt the tile where at last it stops iterating 
9. Later it finds the block in each of the 4 different quadrants and drops them intuitively
10. The problem is then further divided in to smaller subgroups
11. And finally it reaches the main function where the user is asked to enter the value greater than or equal to 3 and if the value if less than 3, the function stops.
