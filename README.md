# CS310
We can calculate the problem by applying the factorial function 
For calculatinng the non-negative integers we can use the formula n-k+1Ck
For calculatinng the positive integers we can use the formula k-1Cn-1

And we will be combining these two formulas to get the answere

### The algorithm is as follows:
First we will be load the numbers n and k.
The we will need to find the integral solutions of non-negative and positive numbers.
Later we will be adding both of those formulas.
And at last returning the answer.
