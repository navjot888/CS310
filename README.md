We can calculate the problem by applying the bubble sort algorith 
We will use the swapping function to for the elements to get in order if they tend to be out of order
Then we will use the adaptive bubble sort function in order to compare the inputted values


### The algorithm is as follows:
1. First we will be load the numbers n and m.
2. Then we will be using the swapping function in order to swap.
3. Later applying the bubble sort algorithm to compute the permutations
4. And at last using the random shuffling.
