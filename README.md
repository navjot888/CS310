# CS310 Assignment #3
We can list all the solutions for the given provided inputs by the following algorithm:


1. We have introduced an array function to display all the values of the array
2. Then created a function to computer the list of all values of the array
3. Later initialized the for loop that will take the input values of n and k and it loop through
4. The function will prompt user to enter the input value of variable n which is greater than or equal to 2
5. the function then accepts the value and processes it
6. In the same way it takes teh value of the k and processes it
7. And finally it finds the values of integers entered.
