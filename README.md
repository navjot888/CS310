# CS310
We can calculate the problem by resursion function.


### The algorithm is as follows:
1. First we create a recursion function for printing all the bit sequences without any consecutivce 0's
2. Then we will list the base for printing the list of the bit sequence.
3. The we will be cojoining 0 to the final output and recurring with 1 digit less if and only if the last of the bit number is 1
4. Then calling the recursion function to append 1 to the results and recur with 1 less digit
5. And at last creating the maing function for inputting the numbers.
