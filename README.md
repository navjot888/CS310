# CS310 Assignment #3
This function calculates the average numnber of comparisons by following the algorithm below

1. We have introduced a swapping function which is used to assemble the elements in order if they then to be out of order
2. Then we have introduced the bubble sort to sort the elements.
3. Inside the bubble sort we have introduced a variable named comparison and then generated a for loop.
4. Later in that for loop we have introdroduced another variable named traverse and a for loop under it.
5. It then proceeds by loopiing along the for loop.
6. And if there is no change in the sorting then it returns back to the initial state by returnign the comparison variable.
7. We have then created the function for calculating the average number of comparisons using float.
8. First initialised the total_comparison to zero
9. Then inintialized the while loop which keeps on iterating until it finds the average number of comparisons when the inputs n and m are provided.
